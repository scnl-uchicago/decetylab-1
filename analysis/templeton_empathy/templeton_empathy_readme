This folder contains all R scripts to clean and analyze data from Canada, China, Jordan, South Africa, Turkey, and the US in years 1 and 2 of the Templeton project.
Qualtrics data files are owned and shared by Jean Decety. Dropbox files are owned and shared by Jason Cowell. Other data files are on the deectylab server (ssdfiles.uchicago.edu\decetylab)
Data for each child are coded with a unique ID, a composite of the country and oiginal subject ID. 

calculate_QCAE.Rmd calculates QCAE scores for parents and children and writes them into "templeton_qcae_calculations.csv."
QCAE calculations are based off of descriptions in decetylab\projects\research\CrossCulturalMoralDevelopment\Questionnaires\QCAE\QCAE_scoring.pdf
The script reads in the following files:
- Consolidated Questionnaire - English - CA_June 3, 2020_15.27.csv (raw output from "Consolidated Questionnaire - English -CA" Qualtrics survey)
- Parent QCAE - China_June 3, 2020_15.11 (raw output from "Parent QCAE - China" Qualtrics survey)
- QCAE- China_June 3, 2020_15.15 (raw output from "QCAE- China" Qualtrics survey)
- South Africa - All Questionnaires_June 3, 2020_15.35 (raw output from "South Africa - All Questionnaires_June 3, 2020_15.35" Qualtrics survey)
- USA- All Questionnaires_June 3, 2020_15.34 (raw output from "USA- All Questionnaires" Qualtrics survey)
- Turkish_3-5years_merged_data_for_chicago_v1.csv (conversion to csv of Turkish_3-5years_merged_data_for_chicago_v1.sav on Dropbox under CCMD Merge Data/Countries/Turkey/SPSS/Full)
- Turkish_6-12years_merged_data_for_chicago_v1.csv (conversion to csv of Turkish_6-12years_merged_data_for_chicago_v1.sav on Dropbox under CCMD Merge Data/Countries/Turkey/SPSS/Full)
- jordan qualtrics.csv (conversion to csv of jordan qualtrics.xlsx on Dropbox under CCMD Merge Data/NEW Mastersheets and Consolidations)
Note: The calculations for the Turkey and Jordan data assume that scores were entered so that 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = slightly disagree, 3 = slightly agree, and 4 = strongly agree. It assumes that no reverse-scoring was done during data entry.

calculate_age.Rmd calculates ages in months and years based on the following files on the decetylab server. All files were first manually converted to .csv format.
The calculated ages are written into a file called "templeton_age_calculations.csv."
- decetylab\projects\research\CrossCulturalMoralDevelopment\DATA\Qualtrics Full Data\canada.xslx
- decetylab\projects\research\CrossCulturalMoralDevelopment\DATA\Qualtrics Select Data\china full qualtrics 1.xslx
- decetylab\projects\research\CrossCulturalMoralDevelopment\DATA\Qualtrics Select Data\china full qualtrics 2.xslx
- decetylab\projects\research\CrossCulturalMoralDevelopment\DATA\Qualtrics Select Data\china partial qualtrics 2.xslx
- decetylab\projects\research\CrossCulturalMoralDevelopment\DATA\Qualtrics Full Data\jordan qualtrics.xslx
- decetylab\projects\research\CrossCulturalMoralDevelopment\DATA\Qualtrics Full Data\south africa qualtrics.xslx
- decetylab\projects\research\CrossCulturalMoralDevelopment\DATA\Qualtrics Full Data\turkish_mergeddata_allages.sav
- decetylab\projects\research\CrossCulturalMoralDevelopment\DATA\Qualtrics Full Data\US Full Qualtrics.xlsx
Due to slight imprecision in age calculations in the script (likely due to inconsistencies during leap years), calculations of age were off by 1 month for 2.1% of participants.
Age in months were calculated separately for these participants using Google Sheets' DATEDIF function and checked against https://www.calculator.net/age-calculator.html, then updated individually in the script.

find_gender.Rmd compiles gender information from the following files and writes the results into a file called "templeton_gender_compilation.csv":
- Dropbox/CCMD Merge Data/Countries/Canada/Excel/Master_CA.xlsx
- Dropbox/CCMD Merge Data/Countries/China/Excel files/CCMD_China_2013+2014.xlsx
- Dropbox/CCMD Merge Data/Countries/Jordan/Excel/Master_ Jordan.xls
- Dropbox/CCMD Merge Data/Countries/South Africa/Excel/Mastersheet South Africa.xls
- Dropbox/CCMD Merge Data/Countries/Turkey/SPSS/Agg/Membership_TK.sav
- Dropbox/CCMD Merge Data/Countries/USExcel/Master_US_aug062014.xlsx
In the case that genders could not be found in these files, they were taken from PrimaryCountries_Years1&2_2.csv (conversion to csv of PrimaryCountries_Years1&2_2.sav on Dropbox under CCMD Merge Data/MasterSheets)





combine_data.Rmd combines...





Output files from each script, besides combine_data.Rmd, are saved to a Dropbox folder called Templeton Empathy owned by Jean Decety under the folder Analysis/Data Cleaning.
Columns with the prefix "vk" specify intermediate calculations and compilations of multiple columns, to distinguish these from previously compiled variables with the same name.
The final compilation of clean data generated by combine_data.Rmd is saved under Dropbox/Templeton Empathy/ Analysis.
